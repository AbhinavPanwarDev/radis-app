## ðŸŒ± Radis App

**RADIS app** is a web application for [Radis](https://github.com/radis/radis)  high-resolution infrared molecular spectra. Instead of writing code, this project aims to create an intuitive user interface (UI).

It use radis internally to produce this exquisite spectrum, and the updated version and radis algorithm make it incredibly efficient to compute the millions of lines in only a few minutes.

The Radis app leverages **React 18** to offer the user interface, and **FastApi** on the backend. A new version of the app We are using **react-hook-form** for the fastest user experience and to maintain performance in the client slide. In the backend, we use **FastApi**  to offer the fastest response.


## âœ…Â **Installation**

### Locally

cd frontend # go to frontend directory
yarn install # install all dependencies
yarn start # to start local dev server
```

```

### Docker

we are working on to support, installation using docker also.

## âœ…Â ****Usage****

We created this app with the intention of giving both researchers and non-researchers access to the most valuable elements of Radis via a straightforward online application. Our team and contributors are always trying to make the app better. The app has additional features and capabilities in newer versions.
